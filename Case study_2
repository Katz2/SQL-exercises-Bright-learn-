I have been provided with a dataset titled “Bright Car Sales”, which captures daily
transactional and pricing information for vehicles sold by Bright Motors.
Bright Motors has recently appointed a new Head of Sales, whose mission is to expand
the dealership network, improve sales performance, and optimize inventory. My role, as
a Junior Data Analyst, is to extract actionable insights from the historical car sales data
and prepare a presentation that will help guide future sales and marketing strategies.
